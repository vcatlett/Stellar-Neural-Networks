## Spectral Typing Stars with a Classification Neural Network

This is an example of a simple classification neural network applied on a modified version of the data from the [HYG Database](http://www.astronexus.com/hyg). Details of the network and sources can be found in our report.

```clean_HR.csv``` contains the data. 

To use the network, run the ```all_calculations.m``` script after making any appropriate modifications to it (as indicated by the comments in the script).

The ```plot_back.m``` is the only function which is not called by ```all_calculations.m```. It includes an alternative method to plot the results (see the comments in the script).
